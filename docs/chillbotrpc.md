## About The RPC

ChillBot's music RPC works similar to what Spotify does for status activities. Once the program starts running, your status will show that there are no music currently playing.


If you run the [play command](https://docs.chillbot.cloud/#/categories?id=play-command), your status will change showing that the song you're listening to currently. Keep in mind that it is currently in beta, so it won't 100% work.
